Creating this blog is satisfying a weird urge I've recently gotten when having
nothing to do, which is fixing and playing about with little things without
having to create an entire new project.

For example playing around with the fonts on this site, is fun for practising
some CSS changes with web-fonts. It's little but it satisfies the part of me
that makes me angry that I've done nothing. What have I done today? More font
changes to make the blog easier to the eye, whilst also authoring this blog
post.

Little changes have made a huge change to my self-fulfilment, and hopefully
I'll keep updating this blog as I get closer to university, as well as in the
semester.

But that's all for today. See ya!
