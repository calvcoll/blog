So, I'm writing a blog again. I never really had any topics I felt like talking
about on this blog, but a friend starting their own has got me thinking that I
should restart the blog to better my English writing skills, which I apparently
didn't nurture enough in school. ðŸ˜œ

So far this summer I've spent most of my time playing games, catching up with
friends online or chatting to online and uni mates through Twitter and Facebook.
The annoying part of my holiday however is spending time coming up with a project
for my final year of university, of which I believe I have finally reached the
topic that I will use, but I'm waiting on acceptance from my lecturers for the
project. Which sucks. ðŸ˜¥
